##  Overview

This project focuses on streamlining material and information flow in the paint shop of Bajaj Auto Ltd. using **Lean Manufacturing tools** like **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)** and implementing an Android application called **PartTracker** to digitize and optimize shop floor communication and tracking.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze current material and information flow in the paint shop
- Identify waste and reduce non-value-added (NVA) time
- Improve Material Flow Index (MFI)
- Design and deploy an Android application (PartTracker) for real-time production tracking and planning

---

##  Methodology

###  Value Stream Mapping
- Created **Current State VSM** of paint shop operations
- Identified bottlenecks in:
  - Manual inspection & storage
  - 3M sanding and polishing
  - Manual data transfer (WhatsApp, whiteboards)
- Designed a **Future State VSM** with:
  - Inline sanding and polishing station
  - Elimination of redundant substations
  - Improved layout and flow

###  Time Study (Sample Results)
| Process                         | Time (sec) |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Unloading & Storage (Manual)  | 55         |
| Sanding & Polishing (Gun)     | 840 (Total)|
| Time Saved (Per Part)         | ‚è±Ô∏è **50 sec** (~21% reduction) |

---

##  Improvements Achieved

-  **Reduced Lead Time**: 21% decrease in total processing time per part
-  **Improved MFI**: Due to inline sanding/polishing and better flow layout
-  **Eliminated Manual Tracking**: Replaced WhatsApp + whiteboards with a centralized system
-  **Kaizen Implementation**: Line balancing, ergonomic handling, and reduced WIP

##  PartTracker App

A custom Android app built using Kotlin and Firebase, tailored to paint shop needs:

###  Features
- QR-based part identification and tracking  
- Shift-wise production planning dashboard  
- Real-time scan logs and traceability  
- Model-wise and color-wise part entry  
- Dashboard for Planned vs Produced vs Closing Balance  
- Full scan history for auditing

###  Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Kotlin (Android Studio)
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Sheets API (for redundancy & traceability)
- **QR Code Gen/Scan**: Custom logic per part/trolley/month
